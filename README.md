# PlantUML Styles
Styles which can be applied to [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) diagrams. Typically included in Confluence pages.

To use these styles, include this line in your plantuml file, as the next line after `@startuml`

`!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marlon-be/plantuml-styles/master/styles.plantuml!0`

The examples (see `examples` directory) allow you to test the styles. Use *Visual Studio Code*, along with the [PlantUML add-on](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml).
